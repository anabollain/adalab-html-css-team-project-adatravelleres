## Specifications

The client [Adalab](https://adalab.es/) asked us to develop a web application with the following **instructions**:

- To use **HTML5** and **Sass**.
- To use **mediaqueries** and other techniques to create a **Responsive Design** that would adapt to all devices.
- To follow an **Established Design** given in **Zeplin** with the following sizes:
    - **mobile, under 768px**
    - **tablet, from 768px to 1200px**
    - **desktop, over 1200px**
- To use **git version control** during the development of the product.
- To publish the final result online using **GitHub Pages** static server.


## Description

The web application consists on two pages:

- **Home** with the general information about the team. 
- **Contact** with a form that the user can fill to reach us. 

With the followig common elements:

- A fixed **Header** with the team name and a navigation menu to the different sections.
- A **Footer** with the copyright, a navigation menu and Adalab's logo.


## Design

Our client shared the design through [Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/). The main layout had to be respected, but small variations in the color palette, images and details could be implemented to customize the project and make it our own.

Inspired in the joy and freedom that traveling brings to all of us, we have chosen photos that lead the user to the moment of packing and planning their next trip, to the excitement and happiness of creating new memories and meeting new cultures.

The palette is warm, in tune with wild landscapes, where we become one with nature. The green refers to the vegetation, the forest, while the orange and brown tones allude to the earth, the wood and the sand. 

### Main site

The main site consist of:

- A **photo** that represents the team
- A **claim** that identifies the team
- A **team** section with the description of our strengths and weaknesses
- A **who we are** section with the information of each team member: name, photo, a short bio and the links to our social media.

### Contact form

In the **contact** page you will find a form to fill the following information: name, email, phone and message. The **send** button is linked to a [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to be able to send the requests to a server.


## Final result

You can have a look of the outcome in Github Pages: **[Adatravellers](https://anabollain.github.io/adalab-html-css-team-project-adatravelleres/)**. 

We hope you enjoy it as much as we did ðŸ˜‰.
